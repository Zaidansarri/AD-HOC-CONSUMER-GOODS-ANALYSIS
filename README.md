- Extracted and cleaned data to answer Ad-hoc business requests.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
- Created **interactive dashboards** to highlight key trends and patterns.  
- Transformed raw data into visually compelling insights.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Design (PowerPoint)**  
- Structured insights in an **executive-friendly format** for easy consumption.
